<p>oward sundown, in the murky drizzle,
the man who called himself Ord
brought Lieutenant colonel William
Barrett Travis word that the Mexican
light cavalry had completely invested
Bexar, and that some light guns were
being set up across the San Antonio
River. Even as he spoke, there was a
flash and bang from the west, and a
shell screamed over the old mission
walls. Travis looked worried.</p>

<div>
<img class="figright" src="images/image_001_01.jpg" width="199" height="337" alt="" />
<img class="figright" src="images/image_001_02.jpg" width="500" height="390" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"What kind of guns?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing to worry about, sir," Ord
said. "Only a few one-pounders, nothing
of respectable siege caliber. General
Santa Anna has had to move too
fast for any big stuff to keep up." Ord
spoke in his odd accent. After all, he
was a Britainer, or some other kind of
foreigner. But he spoke good Spanish,
and he seemed to know everything.
In the four or five days since he had
appeared he had become very useful
to Travis.</p>

<p>Frowning, Travis asked, "How
many Mexicans, do you think, Ord?"</p>

<p>"Not more than a thousand, now,"
the dark-haired, blue-eyed young man
said confidently. "But when the main
body arrives, there'll be four, five
thousand."</p>

<p>Travis shook his head. "How do
you get all this information, Ord?
You recite it like you had read it all
some place&mdash;like it were history."</p>

<p>Ord merely smiled. "Oh, I don't
know <i>everything</i>, colonel. That is why
I had to come here. There is so much
we don't know about what happened.... I
mean, sir, what will happen&mdash;in the Alamo."
His sharp eyes grew puzzled for an instant.
"And some things don't seem to match up,
somehow&mdash;"</p>

<p>Travis looked at him sympathetically. Ord
talked queerly at times, and Travis suspected
he was a bit deranged. This was understandable,
for the man was undoubtedly a Britainer
aristocrat, a refugee from Napoleon's thousand-year
Empire. Travis had heard about
the detention camps and the charcoal ovens
... but once, when he had mentioned the
<i>Empereur's</i> sack of London in '06, Ord had
gotten a very queer look in his eyes, as if he
had forgotten completely.</p>

<p>But John Ord, or whatever his
name was, seemed to be the only man
in the Texas forces who understood
what William Barrett Travis was trying
to do. Now Travis looked around
at the thick adobe wall surrounding
the old mission in which they stood.
In the cold, yellowish twilight even
the flaring cook fires of his hundred
and eighty-two men could not dispel
the ghostly air that clung to the old
place. Travis shivered involuntarily.
But the walls were thick, and they
could turn one-pounders. He asked,
"What was it you called this place,
Ord ... the Mexican name?"</p>

<p>"The Alamo, sir." A slow, steady
excitement seemed to burn in the
Britainer's bright eyes. "Santa Anna
won't forget that name, you can be
sure. You'll want to talk to the other
officers now, sir? About the message
we drew up for Sam Houston?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," Travis said absently.
He watched Ord head for the
walls. No doubt about it, Ord understood
what William Barrett Travis
was trying to do here. So few of the
others seemed to care.</p>

<p>Travis was suddenly very glad that
John Ord had shown up when he did.</p>

<p>On the walls, Ord found the man
he sought, broad-shouldered and tall
in a fancy Mexican jacket. "The commandant's
compliments, sir, and he
desires your presence in the chapel."</p>

<p>The big man put away the knife
with which he had been whittling.
The switchblade snicked back and
disappeared into a side pocket
of the jacket, while Ord watched it with
fascinated eyes. "What's old Bill got
his britches hot about this time?" the
big man asked.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't know, sir," Ord said
stiffly and moved on.</p>

<p><i>Bang-bang-bang</i> roared the small
Mexican cannon from across the river.
<i>Pow-pow-pow!</i> The little balls only
chipped dust from the thick adobe
walls. Ord smiled.</p>

<p>He found the second man he
sought, a lean man with a weathered
face, leaning against a wall and chewing
tobacco. This man wore a long,
fringed, leather lounge jacket, and he
carried a guitar slung beside his Rock
Island rifle. He squinted up at Ord.
"I know ... I know," he muttered.
"Willy Travis is in an uproar again.
You reckon that colonel's commission
that Congress up in Washington-on-the-Brazos
give him swelled his
head?"</p>

<p>Rather stiffly, Ord said, "Colonel,
the commandant desires an officers'
conference in the chapel, now." Ord
was somewhat annoyed. He had not
realized he would find these Americans
so&mdash;distasteful. Hardly preferable
to Mexicans, really. Not at all as
he had imagined.</p>

<p>For an instant he wished he had
chosen Drake and the Armada instead
of this pack of ruffians&mdash;but no, he
had never been able to stand sea sickness.
He couldn't have taken the
Channel, not even for five minutes.</p>

<p>And there was no changing now.
He had chosen this place and time
carefully, at great expense&mdash;actually,
at great risk, for the X-4-A had aborted
twice, and he had had a hard time
bringing her in. But it had got him
here at last. And, because for a historian
he had always been an impetuous
and daring man, he grinned now,
thinking of the glory that was to
come. And he was a participant&mdash;much
better than a ringside seat!
Only he would have to be careful, at
the last, to slip away.</p>

<p>John Ord knew very well how this
coming battle had ended, back here
in 1836.</p>

<p>He marched back to William Barrett
Travis, clicked heels smartly.
Travis' eyes glowed; he was the only
senior officer here who loved military
punctilio. "Sir, they are on the way."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Ord," Travis hesitated
a moment. "Look, Ord. There will be
a battle, as we know. I know so little
about you. If something should happen
to you, is there anyone to write?
Across the water?"</p>

<p>Ord grinned. "No, sir. I'm afraid
my ancestor wouldn't understand."</p>

<p>Travis shrugged. Who was he to
say that Ord was crazy? In this day
and age, any man with vision was
looked on as mad. Sometimes he felt
closer to Ord than to the others.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="55" height="50" /></div>
<p>he two officers Ord had summoned
entered the chapel. The big
man in the Mexican jacket tried to
dominate the wood table at which
they sat. He towered over the slender,
nervous Travis, but the commandant,
straight-backed and arrogant, did not
give an inch. "Boys, you know Santa
Anna has invested us. We've been
fired on all day&mdash;" He seemed to be
listening for something. <i>Wham!</i> Outside,
a cannon split the dusk with
flame and sound as it fired from the
walls. "There is my answer!"</p>

<p>The man in the lounge coat
shrugged. "What I want to know is
what our orders are. What does old
Sam say? Sam and me were in Congress
once. Sam's got good sense; he
can smell the way the wind's blowin'."
He stopped speaking and hit his
guitar a few licks. He winked across
the table at the officer in the Mexican
jacket who took out his knife. "Eh,
Jim?"</p>

<p>"Right," Jim said. "Sam's a good
man, although I don't think he ever
met a payroll."</p>

<p>"General Houston's leaving it up to
me," Travis told them.</p>

<p>"Well, that's that," Jim said unhappily.
"So what you figurin' to do,
Bill?"</p>

<p>Travis stood up in the weak, flickering
candlelight, one hand on the
polished hilt of his saber. The other
two men winced, watching him.
"Gentlemen, Houston's trying to pull
his militia together while he falls
back. You know, Texas was woefully
unprepared for a contest at arms. The
general's idea is to draw Santa Anna
as far into Texas as he can, then hit
him when he's extended, at the right
place, and right time. But Houston
needs more time&mdash;Santa Anna's
moved faster than any of us anticipated.
Unless we can stop the Mexican
Army and take a little steam out
of them, General Houston's in trouble."</p>

<p>Jim flicked the knife blade in and
out. "Go on."</p>

<p>"This is where we come in, gentlemen.
Santa Anna can't leave a force
of one hundred eighty men in his
rear. If we hold fast, he must attack
us. But he has no siege equipment,
not even large field cannon." Travis'
eye gleamed. "Think of it, boys!
He'll have to mount a frontal attack,
against protected American riflemen.
Ord, couldn't your Englishers tell him
a few things about that!"</p>

<p>"Whoa, now," Jim barked. "Billy,
anybody tell you there's maybe four
or five thousand Mexicaners comin'?"</p>

<p>"Let them come. Less will leave!"</p>

<p>But Jim, sour-faced turned to the
other man. "Davey? You got something
to say?"</p>

<p>"Hell, yes. How do we get out,
after we done pinned Santa Anna
down? You thought of that, Billy
boy?"</p>

<p>Travis shrugged. "There is an element
of grave risk, of course. Ord,
where's the document, the message
you wrote up for me? Ah, thank
you." Travis cleared his throat.
"Here's what I'm sending on to general
Houston." He read, "Commandancy
of the Alamo, February 24,
1836 ... are you sure of that date,
Ord?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure of that," Ord said.</p>

<p>"Never mind&mdash;if you're wrong we
can change it later. 'To the People of
Texas and all Americans in the
World. Fellow Freemen and Compatriots!
I am besieged with a thousand
or more Mexicans under Santa Anna.
I have sustained a continual bombardment
for many hours but have not
lost a man. The enemy has demanded
surrender at discretion, otherwise, the
garrison is to be put to the sword, if
taken. I have answered the demand
with a cannon shot, and our flag still
waves proudly over the walls. I shall
never surrender or retreat. Then, I
call on you in the name of liberty, of
patriotism and everything dear to the
American character&mdash;" He paused,
frowning, "This language seems pretty
old-fashioned, Ord&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir. That's exactly right,"
Ord murmured.</p>

<p>"'... To come to our aid with all
dispatch. The enemy is receiving reinforcements
daily and will no doubt
increase to three or four thousand in
four or five days. If this call is neglected,
I am determined to sustain
myself as long as possible and die like
a soldier who never forgets what is
due his honor or that of his homeland.
VICTORY OR DEATH!'"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="55" height="50" /></div>
<p>ravis stopped reading, looked up.
"Wonderful! Wonderful!" Ord
breathed. "The greatest words of defiance
ever written in the English
tongue&mdash;and so much more literate
than that chap at Bascogne."</p>

<p>"You mean to send that?" Jim
gasped.</p>

<p>The man called Davey was holding
his head in his hands.</p>

<p>"You object, Colonel Bowie?" Travis
asked icily.</p>

<p>"Oh, cut that 'colonel' stuff, Bill,"
Bowie said. "It's only a National
Guard title, and I like 'Jim' better,
even though I am a pretty important
man. Damn right I have an objection!
Why, that message is almost aggressive.
You'd think we wanted to fight
Santa Anna! You want us to be
marked down as warmongers? It'll
give us trouble when we get to the
negotiation table&mdash;"</p>

<p>Travis' head turned. "Colonel
Crockett?"</p>

<p>"What Jim says goes for me, too.
And this: I'd change that part about
all Americans, et cetera. You don't
want anybody to think we think we're
better than the Mexicans. After all,
Americans are a minority in the
world. Why not make it 'all men who
love security?' That'd have world-wide
appeal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Crockett," Travis hissed.</p>

<p>Crockett stood up. "Don't use that
tone of voice to me, Billy Travis!
That piece of paper you got don't
make you no better'n us. I ran for
Congress twice, and won. I know what
the people want&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What the people want doesn't
mean a damn right now," Travis said
harshly. "Don't you realize the tyrant
is at the gates?"</p>

<p>Crockett rolled his eyes heavenward.
"Never thought I'd hear a good
American say that! Billy, you'll never
run for office&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bowie held up a hand, cutting into
Crockett's talk. "All right, Davey.
Hold up. You ain't runnin' for Congress
now. Bill, the main thing I
don't like in your whole message is
that part about victory or death.
That's got to go. Don't ask us to sell
that to the troops!"</p>

<p>Travis closed his eyes briefly.
"Boys, listen. We don't have to tell
the men about this. They don't need
to know the real story until it's too
late for them to get out. And then
we shall cover ourselves with such
glory that none of us shall ever be
forgotten. Americans are the best
fighters in the world when they are
trapped. They teach this in the Foot
School back on the Chatahoochee.
And if we die, to die for one's country
is sweet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hell with that," Crockett drawled.
"I don't mind dyin', but not for these
big landowners like Jim Bowie here.
I just been thinkin'&mdash;I don't own
nothing in Texas."</p>

<p>"I resent that," Bowie shouted.
"You know very well I volunteered,
after I sent my wife off to Acapulco
to be with her family." With an effort,
he calmed himself. "Look, Travis. I
have some reputation as a fighting
man&mdash;you know I lived through the
gang wars back home. It's obvious
this Alamo place is indefensible, even
if we had a thousand men."</p>

<p>"But we must delay Santa Anna at
all costs&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bowie took out a fine, dark Mexican
cigar and whittled at it with his
blade. Then he lit it, saying around it,
"All right, let's all calm down. Nothing
a group of good men can't settle
around a table. Now listen. I got in
with this revolution at first because I
thought old Emperor Iturbide would
listen to reason and lower taxes. But
nothin's worked out, because hot-heads
like you, Travis, queered the
deal. All this yammerin' about liberty!
Mexico is a Republic, under an
Emperor, not some kind of democracy,
and we can't change that. Let's talk
some sense before it's too late. We're
all too old and too smart to be wavin'
the flag like it's the Fourth of July.
Sooner or later, we're goin' to have to
sit down and talk with the Mexicans.
And like Davey said, I own a million
hectares, and I've always paid minimum
wage, and my wife's folks are
way up there in the Imperial Government
of the Republic of Mexico.
That means I got influence in all the
votin' groups, includin' the American
Immigrant, since I'm a minority
group member myself. I think I can
talk to Santa Anna, and even to old
Iturbide. If we sign a treaty now with
Santa Anna, acknowledge the law of
the land, I think our lives and property
rights will be respected&mdash;" He
cocked an eye toward Crockett.</p>

<p>"Makes sense, Jim. That's the way
we do it in Congress. Compromise,
everybody happy. We never allowed
ourselves to be led nowhere we didn't
want to go, I can tell you! And Bill,
you got to admit that we're in better
bargaining position if we're out in the
open, than if old Santa Anna's got us
penned up in this old Alamo."</p>

<p>"Ord," Travis said despairingly.
"Ord, you understand. Help me!
Make them listen!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_o.jpg" alt="O" width="50" height="50" /></div>
<p>rd moved into the candlelight,
his lean face sweating. "Gentlemen,
this is all wrong! It doesn't happen
this way&mdash;"</p>

<p>Crockett sneered, "Who asked you,
Ord? I'll bet you ain't even got a poll
tax!"</p>

<p>Decisively, Bowie said, "We're free
men, Travis, and we won't be led
around like cattle. How about it,
Davey? Think you could handle the
rear guard, if we try to move out of
here?"</p>

<p>"Hell, yes! Just so we're movin'!"</p>

<p>"O.K. Put it to a vote of the men
outside. Do we stay, and maybe get
croaked, or do we fall back and conserve
our strength until we need it?
Take care of it, eh, Davey?"</p>

<p>Crockett picked up his guitar and
went outside.</p>

<p>Travis roared, "This is insubordination!
Treason!" He drew his saber, but
Bowie took it from him and broke it
in two. Then the big man pulled his
knife.</p>

<p>"Stay back, Ord. The Alamo isn't
worth the bones of a Britainer,
either."</p>

<p>"Colonel Bowie, please," Ord cried.
"You don't understand! You <i>must</i> defend
the Alamo! This is the turning
point in the winning of the west! If
Houston is beaten, Texas will never
join the Union! There will be no
Mexican War. No California, no nation
stretching from sea to shining
sea! This is the Americans' manifest
destiny. You are the hope of the future
... you will save the world
from Hitler, from Bolshevism&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Crazy as a hoot owl," Bowie said
sadly. "Ord, you and Travis got to look
at it both ways. We ain't all in the
right in this war&mdash;we Americans got
our faults, too."</p>

<p>"But you are free men," Ord whispered.
"Vulgar, opinionated, brutal&mdash;but
free! You are still better than any
breed who kneels to tyranny&mdash;"</p>

<p>Crockett came in. "O.K., Jim."</p>

<p>"How'd it go?"</p>

<p>"Fifty-one per cent for hightailin'
it right now."</p>

<p>Bowie smiled. "That's a flat majority.
Let's make tracks."</p>

<p>"Comin', Bill?" Crockett asked.
"You're O.K., but you just don't know
how to be one of the boys. You got
to learn that no dog is better'n any
other."</p>

<p>"No," Travis croaked hoarsely. "I
stay. Stay or go, we shall all die like
dogs, anyway. Boys, for the last time!
Don't reveal our weakness to the
enemy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What weakness? We're stronger
than them. Americans could whip the
Mexicans any day, if we wanted to.
But the thing to do is make 'em talk,
not fight. So long, Bill."</p>

<p>The two big men stepped outside.
In the night there was a sudden clatter
of hoofs as the Texans mounted and
rode. From across the river came a
brief spatter of musket fire, then silence.
In the dark, there had been no
difficulty in breaking through the
Mexican lines.</p>

<p>Inside the chapel, John Ord's
mouth hung slackly. He muttered,
"Am I insane? It didn't happen this
way&mdash;it couldn't! The books can't be
<i>that</i> wrong&mdash;"</p>

<p>In the candlelight, Travis hung his
head. "We tried, John. Perhaps it was
a forlorn hope at best. Even if we had
defeated Santa Anna, or delayed him,
I do not think the Indian Nations
would have let Houston get help from
the United States."</p>

<p>Ord continued his dazed muttering,
hardly hearing.</p>

<p>"We need a contiguous frontier
with Texas," Travis continued slowly,
just above a whisper. "But we Americans
have never broken a treaty with
the Indians, and pray God we never
shall. <i>We</i> aren't like the Mexicans,
always pushing, always grabbing off
New Mexico, Arizona, California. <i>We</i>
aren't colonial oppressors, thank God!
No, it wouldn't have worked out,
even if we American immigrants had
secured our rights in Texas&mdash;" He
lifted a short, heavy, percussion pistol
in his hand and cocked it. "I hate to
say it, but perhaps if we hadn't taken
Payne and Jefferson so seriously&mdash;if
we could only have paid lip service,
and done what we really wanted to
do, in our hearts ... no matter. I
won't live to see our final disgrace."</p>

<p>He put the pistol to his head and
blew out his brains.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_o.jpg" alt="O" width="50" height="50" /></div>
<p>rd was still gibbering when the
Mexican cavalry stormed into the old
mission, pulling down the flag and
seizing him, dragging him before the
resplendent little general in green
and gold.</p>

<p>Since he was the only prisoner,
Santa Anna questioned Ord carefully.
When the sharp point of a bayonet
had been thrust half an inch
into his stomach, the Britainer seemed
to come around. When he started
speaking, and the Mexicans realized
he was English, it went better with
him. Ord was obviously mad, it
seemed to Santa Anna, but since he
spoke English and seemed educated,
he could be useful. Santa Anna didn't
mind the raving; he understood all
about Napoleon's detention camps
and what they had done to Britainers
over there. In fact, Santa Anna was
thinking of setting up a couple of
those camps himself. When they had
milked Ord dry, they threw him on a
horse and took him along.</p>

<p>Thus John Ord had an excellent
view of the battlefield when Santa
Anna's cannon broke the American
lines south of the Trinity. Unable to
get his men across to safety, Sam
Houston died leading the last, desperate
charge against the Mexican regulars.
After that, the American survivors
were too tired to run from the
cavalry that pinned them against the
flooding river. Most of them died
there. Santa Anna expressed complete
indifference to what happened to the
Texans' women and children.</p>

<p>Mexican soldiers found Jim Bowie
hiding in a hut, wearing a plain linen
tunic and pretending to be a civilian.
They would not have discovered his
identity had not some of the Texan
women cried out, "Colonel Bowie&mdash;Colonel
Bowie!" as he was led into
the Mexican camp.</p>

<p>He was hauled before Santa Anna,
and Ord was summoned to watch.
"Well, don Jaime," Santa Anna remarked,
"You have been a foolish
man. I promised your wife's uncle to
send you to Acapulco safely, though
of course your lands are forfeit. You
understand we must have lands for
the veterans' program when this campaign
is over&mdash;" Santa Anna smiled
then. "Besides, since Ord here has
told me how instrumental you were
in the abandonment of the Alamo, I
think the Emperor will agree to mercy
in your case. You know, don Jaime,
your compatriots had me worried back
there. The Alamo might have been a
tough nut to crack ... <i>pues</i>, no matter."</p>

<p>And since Santa Anna had always
been broadminded, not objecting to
light skin or immigrant background,
he invited Bowie to dinner that night.</p>

<p>anta Anna turned to Ord. "But if
we could catch this rascally war criminal,
Crockett ... however, I fear
he has escaped us. He slipped over
the river with a fake passport, and the
Indians have interned him."</p>

<p>"S&iacute;, <i>Se&ntilde;or Presidente</i>," Ord said
dully.</p>

<p>"Please, don't call me that," Santa
Anna cried, looking around. "True,
many of us officers have political ambitions,
but Emperor Iturbide is old
and vain. It could mean my head&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly, Ord's head was erect, and
the old, clear light was in his blue
eyes. "Now I understand!" he shouted.
"I thought Travis was raving back
there, before he shot himself&mdash;and
your talk of the Emperor! American
respect for Indian rights! Jeffersonian
form of government! Oh, those
ponces who peddled me that X-4-A&mdash;the
<i>track jumper</i>! I'm not back in
my own past. I've jumped the time
track&mdash;<i>I'm back in a screaming alternate!</i>"</p>

<p>"Please, not so loud, <i>Se&ntilde;or</i> Ord,"
Santa Anna sighed. "Now, we must
shoot a few more American officers,
of course. I regret this, you understand,
and I shall no doubt be much
criticized in French Canada and Russia,
where there are still civilized
values. But we must establish the Republic
of the Empire once and for all
upon this continent, that aristocratic
tyranny shall not perish from the
earth. Of course, as an Englishman,
you understand perfectly, Se&ntilde;or Ord."</p>

<p>"Of course, excellency," Ord said.</p>

<p>"There are soft hearts&mdash;soft heads,
I say&mdash;in Mexico who cry for civil
rights for the Americans. But I must
make sure that Mexican dominance is
never again threatened north of the
Rio Grande."</p>

<p>"<i>Seguro</i>, excellency," Ord said, suddenly.
If the bloody X-4-A <i>had</i>
jumped the track, there was no getting
back, none at all. He was stuck here.
Ord's blue eyes narrowed. "After all,
it ... it is manifest destiny that the
Latin peoples of North America meet
at the center of the continent. Canada
and Mexico shall share the Mississippi."</p>

<p>Santa Anna's dark eyes glowed.
"You say what I have often thought.
You are a man of vision, and much
sense. You realize the <i>Indios</i> must go,
whether they were here first or not.
I think I will make you my secretary,
with the rank of captain."</p>

<p>"<i>Gracias</i>, Excellency."</p>

<p>"Now, let us write my communique
to the capital, <i>Capit&aacute;n</i> Ord. We must
describe how the American abandonment
of the Alamo allowed me to
press the traitor Houston so closely
he had no chance to maneuver his
men into the trap he sought. <i>Ay,
Capit&aacute;n</i>, it is a cardinal principle of
the Anglo-Saxons, to get themselves
into a trap from which they must
fight their way out. This I never let
them do, which is why I succeed
where others fail ... you said something,
<i>Capit&aacute;n</i>?"</p>

<p>"<i>S&iacute;</i>, Excellency. I said, I shall title
our communique: 'Remember the
Alamo,'" Ord said, standing at attention.</p>

<p>"<i>Bueno!</i> You have a gift for words.
Indeed, if ever we feel the <i>gringos</i>
are too much for us, your words shall
once again remind us of the truth!"
Santa Anna smiled. "I think I shall
make you a major. You have indeed
coined a phrase which shall live in
history forever!"</p>
